# Tank Kommander â†¯

## Intro

Aimed at RC hobby vehicles, this software equipment is meant to provide a complete remote solution to control your model.
The concept is actually the one of a ground station.
It will give you full control of any actuator on the vehicle, provide a strong user management, reliable data transmission for a smooth user experience, while being fairly easily customized.

## Tasklist

- [ ] Get joysticks inputs and print them on terminal
- [ ] Establish a communication bridge using sockets
- [ ] Send and receive data between sockets
- [ ] Share a video stream on local network
- [ ] Read and display video stream from local network
- [ ] Imagine config file standards
- [ ] Read config file
- [ ] Create config file
- [ ] Put read and create config file together
- [ ] Nice GUI :)
- [ ] Sound options (optional)

## Features

Features include :
* Network
* Controls
* Feedback
* Video
* UI and user management
* Sound 

### Network

First approach 

The network should always be a local network, for convenience and simplicity of code.

All networks available should always be checked 

### Controls

The app should send control data at a high rate to the vehicle.
As a convention, the server is in the vehicle, because you can reconnect from another device, so it makes more sense.

It should be verified that data hasn't been modified or altered.

### Feedback

### Video

### UI and user management

### Sound
